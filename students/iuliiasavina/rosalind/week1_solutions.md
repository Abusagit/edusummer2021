## Variables and Some Arithmetic

Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000.

Return: The integer corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a and b.

Solution:

`a = int(input())`

`b = int(input())`

`print (a**2 + b**2)`

## Strings and Lists

Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and four integers a, b, c and d.

Return: The slice of this string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

Solution:

`s = str(input())`

`a, b, c, d = int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input())`

`print (s[a:b+1] + ' ' + s[c:d+1])`

## Conditions and Loops 

Given: Two positive integers aa and bb (a<b<10000a<b<10000).

Return: The sum of all odd integers from aa through bb, inclusively.

Solution:

`a = int(input())`

`b = int(input())`
`l = []`

`while a <= b:`

    `if a % 2 != 0:`
    
        `l.append(a)`
        
    `a = a + 1`
    
`print (sum(l))`

## Working with Files

Given: A file containing at most 1000 lines.

Return: A file containing all the even-numbered lines from the original file. Assume 1-based numbering of lines.

Solution:

`f = open('input.txt', 'r')`

`lines = f.readlines()`

`e = []`

`for i in range (0, len(lines)):`

    `if i % 2 != 0:`
    
        `e.append(i)`
        
`even_lines = []`

`for i in e:`

    `even_lines.append(lines[i])`
`f.close()`

`f2 = open('output.txt', 'w')`

`for i in even_lines:`

    `f2.write(str(i) + '\n')`
    
`f2.close()`

## Dictionaries

Given: A string s of length at most 10000 letters.

Return: The number of occurrences of each word in s, where words are separated by spaces. Words are case-sensitive, and the lines in the output can be in any order.

Solution:

`string = open('string.txt', 'r')`

`s = str(string.readline())`

`d = {}`

`for word in s.split():` 

    `if word in d:`
    
        `d[word] += 1`
        
    `else:`
    
        `d[word] = 1`
        
`for key, value in d.items():`

    `print (key, value)`
    
`string.close()
